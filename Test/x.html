<h1>A Test Document</h1><p>This document demonstrates some of the features of <tt>filter.py</tt>. You can write inline code sections like this: <pre>
void src() {
    int *p;
    return;
}
</pre>
 or you can just highlight a variable like <tt>int *p</tt>. You can also do the usual <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <strike>struck out</strike>, and even <u>underlined</u> text. You can ignore characters with \: so **bold** just inserts asterixes.<p>Images are with square brackets: <object data="spanakopita.jpg"></object> and links are with <a href="Test2.sp">double brackets</a>. If you omit the description, then a default one is provided based on the file name (like here <a href="Test2.sp">Test2</a>) or the absolute URLs (like <a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>). Note that spaces around the @ sign are not significant.<p><h2>Lists</h2><p>You should be able to create lists: <ul>

<li>  One Item<p>A continuation of the first item that is very long so it must span multiple lines, but it's still the same item because it is indented to match the text after the bullet. 
<li>  Two Items 
<li>  Three Items, and this one is very long so it must span multiple lines, but it's still the same item because it is indented to match the text after the bullet.<p></ul>
It is also possible to make numbered lists: <ol>

<li>  First item. 
<li>  Second item. 
<li>  Third item.<p></ol>
It should be possible to nest lists: <ul>

<li>  A <ul>

<li>  i <ol>

<li>  1 
<li>  2 
<li>  3 </ol>

<li>  ii </ul>

<li>  B <ul>

<li>  i </ul>
</ul>
Note that typing here is outside the list.<p><h2>Tables</h2><p>Finally, we can make tables: <table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
a </td>
<td>
b </td>
<td>
c </td>
<td>
d </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
e </td>
<td>
f </td>
<td>
g </td>
<td>
h </td>
</tr>
</table>
and text that comes after a table works just fine.<p>There is some flexibility with the formatting: <table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
a </td>
<td>
b </td>
<td>
c </td>
<td>
d </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
e </td>
<td>
f </td>
<td>
g </td>
<td>
h </td>
</tr>
</table>
and text that comes after a table works just fine.<p>In fact, by indenting after a cell, there is quite a lot of flexibility: <table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
a </td>
<td>
b </td>
<td>
c </td>
<td>
d </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
this way permits </td>
<td>
nested tables </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
as </td>
<td>
well </td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
<td>
f </td>
<td>
g </td>
<td>
h </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
p </td>
<td>
q </td>
<td>
r </td>
<td>
s </td>
</tr>
</table>
